# Introduction
Implementation of [A Fast and Robust Place Recognition Approach for Stereo Visual Odometry using LiDAR Descriptors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07267).

# Usage
- Use SO-DSO as stereo visual odometry to generate 3D points and poses using **so_dso**.
- Test place recognition in **place_recognition**.
